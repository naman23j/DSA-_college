## 🚀 Features

This repository covers the following topics:

### 1. 📋 **Stacks**
- **LIFO** (Last In, First Out) data structure.
- Operations: `Push`, `Pop`, `Peek`.
- Use cases: Expression evaluation, function call management.

### 2. 📜 **Queues**
- **FIFO** (First In, First Out) data structure.
- Operations: `Enqueue`, `Dequeue`, `Peek`.
- Use cases: Task scheduling, print queue management.

### 3. 🗂️ **Arrays**
- Contiguous memory allocation.
- Operations: Insertion, deletion, search, and traversal.
- Sorting algorithms like **Bubble Sort** and **Selection Sort**.

### 4. 🔗 **Linked Lists**
- Dynamic data structure with nodes linked via pointers.
- Types: Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List.
- Operations: Insertion, deletion, traversal.
